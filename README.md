**e-Yantra** is a collective initiative by the prestigious  **Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India** [(IIT, Bombay)](http://www.iitb.ac.in) and **Ministry of Human Resource Development, India** ([MHRD](https://mhrd.gov.in/)) that aims to create the next generation of embedded systems engineers with a practical outlook to help provide practical solutions to some of the real world problems. More information about e-Yantra can be found [here](https://www.e-yantra.org).

**e-Yantra** has various sub-programmes to help achieve it's goals and the following are just to name a few.
- *e-Yantra Robotics Competition* ([e-YRC](https://www.e-yantra.org/eyrc))
- *e-Yantra Ideas Competition* ([e-YIC](https://www.e-yantra.org/eyic))
- *e-Yantra Lab Setup Initiative* ([e-LSI](https://www.e-yantra.org/elsi))
- *e-Yantra Farm Setup Initiative* ([e-FSI](https://www.e-yantra.org/efsi))
- etc.

From the above pool of diverse and enriching programmes, **e-Yantra Robotics Competition** is one of the most successful and highly anticipated program around the country.

### e-Yantra Robotics Competition
e-Yantra Robotics Competition is e-Yantra's most distinguished programme specially curated for college students pursuing Bachelor's degree in any technical fields across the country. The programme is one in itself, maybe across the globe, which spans various technologies, embedded systems and amalgamation of these to build a robot to solve real world problems. The programme has a very unique approach to learning where the key idea is:
> "**Learning** while **Bulding and Competing** while **Learning**"

## Problem Statement
e-Yantra Robotics Competition follows a phased approach where the early phases focuses on building on fundamentals and trivial tasks while the final/pre-final phase(s) focuses on a virtually complete solution of the problem at hand. The evaluation of the early stages are easy as the task focuses either on writing a piece of code or enabling certain hardware configuration but evaluation of later stages are difficult as the students are free to create robots with their own ideas about efficiency and perception of depth of challenge. It's usually a non-standard, complex process synergy between software and hardware which which they use to solve problems. The way these final stages and evaluations would go is as follows:
1. The students are provided with the problem statement.
2. The students then, are free to apply their creative insights and cater a solution.
3. The students would record a video of how their robot solves the problem.
4. The team at e-Yantra would manually assess these video submissions.

But due to increased volume of participation and video submission, the question naturally follows:
> "Can the task video evaluation be automated? If yes, till what extent?"
>
> "Can the advances in Image Processing, Deep Learning methods for Computer Vision aid in automating the evaluation process?"

The data we have gathered is from e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2019-2020 which had 6 theses, namely:
- *Biped Patrol (BP)*
- *Construct-O-Bot (CB)*
- *Patrol Fish (PF)*
- *Rapid Rescuer (RR)*
- *Supply Bot (SB)*
- *Survey & Rescue(SR)*

Now or later, accepted or denied, the world is moving towards automation and although we are late, we start now.
